      I am Muhammad Uzair, a passionate and dedicated Computer Systems Engineering student currently in my 3rd year at Hamdard University, Karachi. I have a strong interest in web development, artificial intelligence, and software systems. My current focus is on frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm expanding my knowledge in full-stack development and AI integration.

      I have hands-on experience building both static and interactive websites, as well as creating GUI-based applications using Python. With solid programming foundations in Python, C, and C++, I enjoy solving problems, building efficient systems, and exploring ways to use technology for social good. I‚Äôm always eager to learn and committed to delivering high-quality, meaningful solutions through code.
